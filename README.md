## Overview

"DeltaTraceDB" is an in-memory database (NoSQL) that stores data in units of lists of classes.
This database allows you to register class structures as they are in the database,  
and allows full-text searches of the elements of the registered classes.  
In addition, queries are also classes, and can have DB operation information consisting of   
who, when, what, why, and from.  
If serialized and saved, it provides a very rich source of information for security audits and
usage analysis.  
This is extremely useful for projects with various constraints, such as medical applications.  
(However, please note that when using for medical purposes, each country usually has its own special rules. This database does not take into account the medical circumstances of each country.)  
In addition, for when, the TemporalTrace class has a complete tracing function for   
the communication path and each arrival time.  
I think this would be useful, for example, in space-scale communication networks and relay servers,
where non-negligible delays occur even at the speed of light.  

This package also has a Python backend implementation.  
[Python ver.](https://pypi.org/project/delta-trace-db/)  

I am also developing an open source editor for manually editing the DB contents:  
[DeltaTraceStudio](https://github.com/MasahideMori-SimpleAppli/delta_trace_studio)  

## DB structure

The structure of this DB is as follows.  
In other words, each collection corresponds to a list of each class.  
For this reason, the user is barely aware of the difference between the front end and the back
end,  
and can concentrate on the operation of "obtaining the required class object."

```

```

## Basic DB operations

All operations in this DB are class-based.  
There is no need to learn a new query language.

### 📦 1. Define the model class

First, prepare the model class.  
It is convenient to have the model class inherit ClonableFile from the file_state_manager package.  
If you do not want to inherit ClonableFile, you can also handle Map<String,dynamic> directly with
RawQueryBuilder.  
Here is an example of how to inherit ClonableFile.

```dart
class User extends CloneableFile {
  final int id;
  final String name;
  final int age;
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final DateTime updatedAt;
  final Map<String, dynamic> nestedObj;

  User({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.age,
    required this.createdAt,
    required this.updatedAt,
    required this.nestedObj,
  });

  static User fromDict(Map<String, dynamic> src) =>
      User(
        id: src['id'],
        name: src['name'],
        age: src['age'],
        createdAt: DateTime.parse(src['createdAt']),
        updatedAt: DateTime.parse(src['updatedAt']),
        nestedObj: src['nestedObj'],
      );

  @override
  Map<String, dynamic> toDict() =>
      {
        'id': id,
        'name': name,
        'age': age,
        'createdAt': createdAt.toUtc().toIso8601String(),
        'updatedAt': DateTime.now().toUtc().toIso8601String(),
        'nestedObj': {...nestedObj},
      };

  @override
  User clone() => User.fromDict(toDict());
}
```

### 🏗️ 2. Initialize the DB and add data

```dart

final db = DeltaTraceDatabase();
final now = DateTime.now();
final users = [
  User(id: -1, // Dummy Value
      name: 'Taro',
      age: 25,
      createdAt: now,
      updatedAt: now,
      nestedObj: {"a": "a"}),
  User(id: -1,
      name: 'Jiro',
      age: 30,
      createdAt: now,
      updatedAt: now,
      nestedObj: {"a": "b"}),
];

// Here, you can specify a serial key to automatically assign an ID.
final query = QueryBuilder.add(target: 'users', addData: users, serialKey: "id").build();
// <User> here is not needed on the server.
// This is a type specification for conversion processing when retrieving data.
final result = db.executeQuery<User>(query);
```

💡 Key Points

- You can add, update, and delete data by simply passing the query generated by QueryBuilder to
  executeQuery.
- This query can be serialized as a Map<String, dynamic> using the toDict method, so it can be sent
  to the server as is and reflected in a remote database if necessary.
- If you prepare a process equivalent to executeQuery on the server side, you can process it with
  the same query structure.
- Most of what is required on the server side is user permission confirmation and logging, and
  logging is also very easy since you can just save the query as is.
- To return results from the server to the frontend, simply toDict the QueryResult of executeQuery and return it.

### 🔍 3. Data search (filter + sort + paging)

```dart

final searchQuery = QueryBuilder.search(
  target: 'users',
  queryNode: FieldContains("name", "ro"), // Name contains "ro" (so Taro and Jiro are the targets)
  sortObj: SingleSort(field: 'age', reversed: true), // Descending order by age
  limit: 1, // Only get one result
).build();
final searchResult = db.executeQuery<User>(searchQuery);
// Jiro is obtained.
final matchedUsers = searchResult.convert(User.fromDict);
// Query to paging to the next page.
final pagingQuery = QueryBuilder.search(
    target: 'users',
    queryNode: FieldContains("name", "ro"),
    // When paging, the parameters must be the same as before.
    sortObj: SingleSort(field: 'age', reversed: true),
    limit: 1,
    // Get only one result
    startAfter: searchResult.result
        .last // Specify paging. Note that you can also specify an offset instead of an object.
).build();
final nextPageSearchResult = db.executeQuery<User>(pagingQuery);
// Get Taro.
final nextPageUsers = nextPageSearchResult.convert(User.fromDict);
```

### ✏️ 4. Data update (multiple conditions/partial update)

```dart

final updateQuery = QueryBuilder.update(
  target: 'users',
  queryNode: OrNode([
    FieldEquals('name', 'Taro'),
    FieldEquals('name', 'Jiro'),
  ]),
  overrideData: {'age': 99},
  returnData: true,
).build();

final updateResult = db.executeQuery<User>(updateQuery);
final updated = updateResult.convert(User.fromDict);
```

### ❌ 5. Data Deletion

```dart

final deleteQuery = QueryBuilder.delete(
  target: 'users',
  queryNode: FieldEquals("name", "Jiro"),
).build();

final deleteResult = db.executeQuery<User>(deleteQuery);
```

### 💾 6. Saving and restoring (serialization supported)

```dart
// Save (obtained in Map format). After this, you can encrypt it as you like or save it using your favorite package.
final saved = db.toDict();
// Restore
final loaded = DeltaTraceDatabase.fromDict(saved);
```

🕰️ Full restoration (Query log) is also possible using change logs.  
In delta_trace_db, all change operations (add, update, delete, etc.) are expressed in the Query
class.  
So, by saving this Query as a log in chronological order, you can completely reproduce the DB state
at any point in time.

💡 Why can it be restored?

- All data operations are recorded by Query.
- The same state can be obtained by re-executing the saved query logs in order on an empty DB in the
  initial state.

I recommend a configuration where normal saving is done as a date and time snapshot, and the query
itself is logged.  
This way, you can restore to just before the problem occurred just by applying the query log from
the snapshot saving point onwards,  
and since all other operations are also left in the log, it becomes easy to rebuild the DB.  
The query can have DB operation information consisting of "who, when, what, why, from" as a Cause
class,  
so if you set this appropriately, it will be even easier to identify the problem.

### 🧠 7. Searching in nested fields and searching using other nodes

For nested fields, you can specify the key separated by a ".", such as "nestedObj.a".  
The nodes that can be used in searches are "LogicalNode (And and Or)" and "ComparisonNode (Equals,
etc.)".
Please check the following for available types.  
[logicalNode](https://github.com/MasahideMori-SimpleAppli/delta_trace_db/blob/main/lib/src/query/nodes/logical_node.dart)  
[comparisonNode](https://github.com/MasahideMori-SimpleAppli/delta_trace_db/blob/main/lib/src/query/nodes/comparison_node.dart)  

### 🧬 8. Type conversion/template conversion (conformToTemplate)

The conformToTemplate function is useful when you want to convert saved data into a new structure.  
This function can complement and convert saved data according to a template even if the data is
missing.

```dart
// Original class
class ClassA extends ClonableFile {
  String id;
  String name;

  ClassB(this.id, this.name)
// Omitted
}

final db = DeltaTraceDatabase();
final users = [
  ClassA(id: 'u003', name: 'Hanako')
];
final query = QueryBuilder.add(target: 'users', addData: users).build();
final result = db.executeQuery<User>(query);
// New class to be changed from ClassA
class ClassB extends ClonableFile {
  String id;
  String name;
  int age;

  ClassB(this.id, this.name, this.age)
// Omitted
}

final Query conformQuery = QueryBuilder.conformToTemplate(
  target: 'users',
  template: ClassB(
      id: '', name: '', age: -1), // Undefined age is filled with the initial value of -1
).build();
final QueryResult<ClassB> _ = db.executeQuery<ClassB>(conformQuery);

// => { 'id': 'u003', 'name': 'Hanako', 'age': -1 }
final conformedUser = ClassB.fromDict(db
    .collection("users")
    .raw[0]);
```

### 🔁 9. Transaction Processing

You can use a transaction query if you want to treat multiple queries as a single process.  
When processing with this query, if the return value isSuccess is false,  
the DB will be reverted to the state before the transaction query was executed.  
Please note that internally, the collection to be updated is temporarily buffered in memory,  
so you will need to allocate additional memory for this.  

```dart
    final now = DateTime.now();
    final db = DeltaTraceDatabase();
    List<User> users = [
      User(
        id: 1,
        name: 'Taro',
        age: 25,
        createdAt: now.add(Duration(days: 0)),
        updatedAt: now.add(Duration(days: 0)),
        nestedObj: {},
      ),
      User(
        id: 2,
        name: 'Jiro',
        age: 28,
        createdAt: now.add(Duration(days: 1)),
        updatedAt: now.add(Duration(days: 1)),
        nestedObj: {},
      ),
      User(
        id: 3,
        name: 'Saburo',
        age: 31,
        createdAt: now.add(Duration(days: 2)),
        updatedAt: now.add(Duration(days: 2)),
        nestedObj: {},
      ),
      User(
        id: 4,
        name: 'Hanako',
        age: 17,
        createdAt: now.add(Duration(days: 3)),
        updatedAt: now.add(Duration(days: 3)),
        nestedObj: {},
      ),
    ];
    // add
    final Query q1 = QueryBuilder.add(target: 'users1', addData: users).build();
    final Query q2 = QueryBuilder.add(target: 'users2', addData: users).build();
    QueryResult<User> _ = db.executeQuery<User>(q1);
    QueryResult<User> _ = db.executeQuery<User>(q2);
    // Failed transactions
    final TransactionQuery tq1 = TransactionQuery(
      queries: [
        QueryBuilder.update(
          target: 'users1',
          // type error
          queryNode: FieldEquals("id", "3"),
          overrideData: {"id": "5"},
          returnData: true,
          mustAffectAtLeastOne: true,
        ).build(),
        QueryBuilder.clear(target: 'users2').build(),
      ],
    );
    // result.isSuccess is false. The DB hasn't changed.
    // The rewind applies to all collections in the DB (in this case, users1 and users2).
    QueryExecutionResult result = db.executeQueryObject(tq1);
    // Success　transactions
    final TransactionQuery tq2 = TransactionQuery(
      queries: [
        QueryBuilder.update(
          target: 'users1',
          queryNode: FieldEquals("id", 3),
          // Be careful with the overriding type: This library allows overriding with other types.
          overrideData: {"id": 5},
          returnData: true,
          mustAffectAtLeastOne: true,
        ).build(),
        QueryBuilder.clear(target: 'users2').build(),
      ],
    );
    QueryExecutionResult result2 = db.executeQueryObject(tq2);
```

### 🗑️ 10. Deletion Process

After creating the DB structure, if you absolutely need to modify it,  
there is a command to delete a collection.

However, this command is intended **only for administrative maintenance**:
- It cannot be included in transactional queries.
- It does not trigger any UI callbacks at runtime.

Use it with caution if necessary.

```dart
final db = DeltaTraceDatabase();
final q1 = RawQueryBuilder
        .add(
        target: "user", rawAddData: [{"id": -1, "name": "a"}, {"id": -1, "name": "a"}], serialKey: "id")
        .build();
final r1 = db.executeQuery(q1);
final q2 = RawQueryBuilder.removeCollection(target: "user").build();
final r2 = db.executeQuery(q2);
```

## ⚠️ 🕒 Be careful when handling date and time!

"DeltaTraceDB" can handle datetimes without a time zone (local time) and with a time zone (UTC in Dart), but  
in principle, datetimes without a time zone and those with a time zone cannot be compared correctly.  
These will be treated as False in search comparison calculations, so please be careful when designing the DB contents.  
If a backend or cloud is involved, we recommend standardizing the time zone to UTC.  
Alternatively, using UNIX Time integer values is fast and convenient.  
If you want to see in detail how it actually works, check out the [test code](https://github.com/MasahideMori-SimpleAppli/delta_trace_db/blob/main/test/timezone_search_test.dart).  

## Speed

This package is an in-memory database, so it is generally fast.  
Currently, there is no mechanism to speed it up, but it works almost the same as a for loop in a program,  
so there is usually no problem with around 100,000 records.  
I recommend that you test it in an actual environment using speed_test.dart in the test folder.  
However, since it consumes RAM capacity according to the amount of data,  
if you need an extremely large database, consider using a general database.  
For reference, below are the results of a speed test (test/speed_test.dart) run on a slightly  
older PC equipped with a Ryzen 3600 CPU.  
The test conditions were chosen to take a sufficiently long time, but I think it will rarely
cause   
any problems in practical use.
Please note that speeds also depend on the amount of data, so if you have a lot of large data, it will be slower.

## Future plans

It is possible to speed up the database, but this is a low priority, so I think that improving
usability and creating peripheral tools will take priority.

## Notes

This package is intended for single-threaded operation.  
Please note that additional processing, such as message passing, is required for parallel processing where memory is not shared.  

## Support

There is essentially no support at this time, but bugs will likely be fixed.  
If you find any issues, please open an issue on GitHub.

## About version control

The C part will be changed at the time of version upgrade.  
However, versions less than 1.0.0 may change the file structure regardless of the following rules.

- Changes such as adding variables, structure change that cause problems when reading previous
  files.
    - C.X.X
- Adding methods, etc.
    - X.C.X
- Minor changes and bug fixes.
    - X.X.C
